[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isiahmeadows/techtonic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isiahmeadows/techtonic) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/isiahmeadows/techtonic](https://badges.gitter.im/isiahmeadows/techtonic.svg)](https://gitter.im/isiahmeadows/techtonic?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A simple, unopinionated, modular test framework meant to simplify your tests. It supports Node 0.10 and later, and browser support is also planned.

*Note that this is a huge work in progress.*

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev techtonic
```

## Usage

To be completed. This is waiting on the completion of the CLI, but for now, you can look at the tests.

## API

To be completed. See the source, tests, and TypeScript definition file for now.

## Remaining work

1. Finish + test the CLI. It's still a work in progress, mostly in testing.
2. Remove Promise dependency, but still keep the stack down between tests.
3. Self-host this module's tests like what Mocha does.
4. Update TypeScript definitions
5. Write the documentation for this project, including the many core assertions.

## License

ISC, unless otherwise stated (two exceptions are lib/inspect.js and lib/util.js).
