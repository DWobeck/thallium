# Testiphile

- **tes ti phil'**

  1. One who loves tests and/or testing.

*Yep. I came up with that myself. I doubt you'll find that in a dictionary
anywhere.*

## Installation

```js
npm install --save-dev isiahmeadows/testiphile
```

## Usage

To be completed. This will probably change with the CLI.

## API

To be completed. See the source, tests, and TypeScript definition file for now.

## Remaining work

1. Introduce timeouts to the async tests.
2. Finish + test the CLI. It's still a work in progress, mostly in testing.
3. Remove Promise dependency, but still keep the stack down between tests.
4. Add support for coroutines (Promise optional) with a duck test.
5. Self-host this module's tests like what Mocha does.
6. Write the documentation for this project, including the many core assertions.
