# reflect.AssertionError Class

```js
new reflect.AssertionError(message, expected, actual)
```

This is a reference to the base AssertionError constructor, largely derived from [`assertion-error`](http://npm.im/assertion-error), but specialized for this module. Unlike that version, this does not have any special `toJSON` method.
