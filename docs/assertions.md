# Assertions

This is a work in progress with literally about 100 distinct methods to individually document. For now, please consult the `thallium/assert` module in the [TypeScript definition file](../assert.d.ts) for an overview of the various assertions. The methods are generally self-explanatory.

Do note that you don't have to use these, and matter of fact, any assertion library works with this. You could even use Chai if you wanted to. This just comes with a preset opinion on assertions, but if you want something else, by all means, use it.
